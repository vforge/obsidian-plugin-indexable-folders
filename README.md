# Obsidian Indexable Folders Plugin

This plugin for Obsidian enhances folder organization by allowing you to prefix folders with an index (e.g., `01_Notes`). It then visually transforms these folders in the file explorer, creating a clean, organized, and navigable structure.

## Features

- **Visual Folder Indexing**: Automatically styles folders named with a `number_` prefix (e.g., `01_Projects`) by displaying the number as a styled "pill" and hiding the prefix from the folder name.
- **Custom Prefixes**: Define non-numeric, case-insensitive prefixes (e.g., `zz`, `archive`) that receive the same styling treatment.
- **Context Menu Actions**: Right-clicking on an indexed folder provides powerful reordering options:
  - **Move up/down**: Shifts the folder's index by one, automatically cascading the change to other folders to maintain a unique sequence.
  - **Update index...**: Opens a dialog to set a specific index, intelligently shifting other folders to accommodate the new position.
- **Indexed Status Bar Path**: The status bar displays the full, styled path of the active file's parent folders, including the index pills, providing clear context for nested notes.
- **Fully Customizable**: Customize separators, colors, and appearance to match your workflow and theme preferences.

The plugin offers extensive customization options through the settings panel:

### Basic Settings

- **Special Prefixes**: Define non-numeric prefixes (e.g., `zz`, `archive`) that receive the same styling treatment
- **Status Bar Separator**: Customize the character used between folder paths in the status bar (default: "â†’")
- **Prefix Separator**: Change the character that separates numeric prefixes from folder names (default: "_")

### Theme Customization

Personalize the appearance of your index labels with custom colors:

- **Label Background Color**: Customize the background color of index pills
- **Label Text Color**: Customize the text color inside index pills

**Supported Color Formats:**

- Hex codes: `#007ACC`, `#FF5733`
- RGB values: `rgb(0, 122, 204)`, `rgba(255, 87, 51, 0.8)`

- Named colors: `blue`, `red`, `transparent`

**Tips:**

- Use CSS variables (like `var(--interactive-accent)`) to maintain consistency with your current Obsidian theme
- Changes are applied instantly without requiring a restart
- The default colors automatically adapt to your theme's accent colors
