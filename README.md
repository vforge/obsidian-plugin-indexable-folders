# Obsidian Indexable Folders Plugin

This plugin for Obsidian enhances folder organization by allowing you to prefix folders with an index (e.g., `01_Notes`). It then visually transforms these folders in the file explorer, creating a clean, organized, and navigable structure.

## Features

- **Visual Folder Indexing**: Automatically styles folders named with a `number_` prefix (e.g., `01_Projects`) by displaying the number as a styled "pill" and hiding the prefix from the folder name.
- **Custom Prefixes**: A settings option allows you to define a list of non-numeric, case-insensitive prefixes (e.g., `zz`, `archive`) that receive the same styling treatment.
- **Context Menu Actions**: Right-clicking on an indexed folder provides powerful reordering options:
  - **Move up/down**: Shifts the folder's index by one, automatically cascading the change to other folders to maintain a unique sequence.
  - **Update index...**: Opens a dialog to set a specific index, intelligently shifting other folders to accommodate the new position.
- **Indexed Status Bar Path**: The status bar displays the full, styled path of the active file's parent folders, including the index pills, providing clear context for nested notes.
- **Customizable Separators**: Both the separator used in the status bar path (defaults to "â†’") and the prefix separator used in folder names (defaults to "_") can be customized in the settings.
